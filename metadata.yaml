description: A pseudonym adopted by Edward Robert, first Earl of Lytton, son of the
  novelist Bulwer-Lytton, and the author of Lucile. Once Meredith was termed third
  among living poets. Lucile is a narrative poem whose heroine, Lucile, is beloved
  by two bitter rivals, the English Lord Alfred Hargrave and the French Duke of Luvois.
  She loves Alfred, but misunderstanding keeps them apart. Long years after, Alfred's
  son and the Duke's niece fall in love, are separated by the old feud but finally
  reunited through the efforts of Lucile, who has become a nursing nun, under the
  name of Soeur Seraphine.
